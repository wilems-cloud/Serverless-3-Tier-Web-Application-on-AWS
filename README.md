# Serverless-3-Tier-Web-Application-on-AWS
This project demonstrates how to deploy a **fully serverless, production-grade 3-tier architecture** on AWS to host a **dynamic Docker-based web application**. It leverages AWS Fargate, RDS, and other managed services to deliver scalability, security, and automation with minimal operational overhead.

### ðŸ§© Problem

A growing **e-commerce startup** wants to deploy a dynamic web application that:
- **Scales automatically** with user demand
- Is **secure by design**
- Requires **no server management**
- Supports **dynamic content** with a robust backend database
- Is **cost-effective** and easy to maintain
